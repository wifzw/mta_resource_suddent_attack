# hud-remaster

This resource replaces the game's HUD textures with higher-res versions from the Xbox 360 release of the game and by [Ash_735](https://gtaforums.com/topic/743010-relsa-remastered-gui-textures-for-sa-inc-mobile-stuff/). It is based on original resources by [vx89](https://community.multitheftauto.com/index.php?p=profile&id=372294) ([hdhud](https://community.multitheftauto.com/index.php?p=resources&s=details&id=11066), [hdradar](https://community.multitheftauto.com/index.php?p=resources&s=details&id=10983)).

This version:
* combines the functionality of [vx89's](https://community.multitheftauto.com/index.php?p=profile&id=372294) [hdhud](https://community.multitheftauto.com/index.php?p=resources&s=details&id=11066) and [hdradar](https://community.multitheftauto.com/index.php?p=resources&s=details&id=10983) resources,
* contains minor script modifications
* has optimized texture images - they have been run through [Dutchman101's PNG optimzer](https://forum.mtasa.com/topic/119032-tool-png-optimizer/) which reduced the overall file size by about 50%.
